    <h3 class="h3">Design Philosophy</h3>
    <p class="page-description">Building a state-of-the-art software that always outperforms the competition is our objective. This begins from the way we think and operate, and it reflects on the philosophy that we share and uphold.</p>
    <div class="image-container-full"><img src="images/principles.png"/></div>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="CoreGuidelines">Core Philosophy</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">Vitech's core guidelines are at the heart of our organization, and it is what differentiates us from the rest. We do not compromise on these, and every employee gives their best to ensure these are guidelines are met.</p>
    </div>
    <h5 class="h5">Meeting Vitech's Goals</h5>
    <p class="inplace-text">Effective user experiences must address company goals, and help make companies successful with an effective design strategy that is aligned with business strategy. Our UX strategy emphasizes the why (business goals), what (vision and priorities), how (success metrics), who (stakeholders), and when (schedules, updates, and milestones) of the project—the details that will provide its structure and demonstrate its progress and evolution. While keeping Vitech's business goals in mind, we also aim to balance our clients' goals each step of the way. This ensures a win-win for both us and our clients.</p>
    <h5 class="h5">Meeting User Needs</h5>
    <p class="inplace-text">Products should not only be usable but also useful. This means they must satisfy the needs of the people using them. To find the users' needs, we need to know the users’ motivations, activities, and problems by gathering data and finding patterns. This helps to tackle the right problems and to get new ideas of what could help the users. Without research, assumptions about the user’s activities with current and future products are often shallow, simplistic, wrong, and do not involve the user’s context. Not spending enough effort and resources leads to the product being "inside-out" (organization and engineer centric) and not "outside-in". We try to get as close to the users as possible by involving SMEs, client POs, etc., and try to conduct user tests at every step we can. </p>
    <h5 class="h5">Clear + Efficient</h5>
    <p class="inplace-text">Our users should quickly be able to understand how to use the app they are in without any training or user manual. While using our apps, our users should realize that they can perform their tasks faster and easier than they can with any alternative solutions. Users now, more than ever, want speed and great usability. As attention spans have decreased and are only going down further, we try to ensure a much better experience by keeping our design and UX clear and straightforward. As our products are used by employees of other organizations, keeping our products clear and efficient directly contributes to their success.</p>
    <h5 class="h5">Consistent</h5>
    <p class="inplace-text">Consistency is one of the most powerful usability principles. When things always behave the same, users don’t have to worry about what will happen and understand it right away. It helps in reducing the learning curve for a product since the user gets familiar with the given experience. Consistent interfaces create trust and provide hope to users that they can rely upon the software (and the organization that builds them) every time. Our Design System initiative with components, interaction design patterns, and content guidelines are geared towards achieving consistency both in terms of visual design and experience.</p>
    <h5 class="h5">Good UI</h5>
    <p class="inplace-text">The visual appeal should inspire confidence in both the app and the people and the organization that created it. A good UI increases the amount of attention potential customers pay to our product and makes them feel comfortable and confident in using our application for its user-friendliness. Our goal is to make our interfaces seamless, intuitive, delightful and less "enterprise-like". </p>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="Process">Process</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">Building a great product requires building an even greater process behind the scenes. Our process follows a multi-step approach. We start with understanding the user and our clients, asking why we are building it, what problems are we solving for the user, etc. Next, we invite stakeholders to understand what data can be gathered using interviews, focus groups, surveys, and talking to SMEs. We analyze the outcome of this research to create personas to know their pain points and goals. Next, we do various stages of design based on all the previous steps - sketches, wireframes, and hi-fidelity visual design. Our digitized mockups are then sent to the engineering team for implementation and are tested. We take this back to the user to check if it addressed their original need. This is an iterative process and by no means a perfect one.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="Platform">Platform</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">A consistent experience is very important across multiple platforms. If users find a different experience on multiple devices, they will need a lot of time to learn and be comfortable with the product. We must adapt the gestures that are native to the devices we target, for instance, drag and drop on desktop, swipe and pinch to zoom on mobiles, etc. It makes sense to abstract certain features that would be overkill on small devices (like editing large grids of data or performing operations that would consume a lot of memory and time). However, this abstraction needs to be communicated clearly to the user with a message like "this feature is available only on desktop".</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="Learning">Learning</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">Scoping requirements, designing, and implementing solutions are all just assumptions until they are tested with real users. We experiment, test assumptions, learn and improve our ideas. We iterate our ideas in small steps to reduce the risks of failure. We value testing with users, comparing with other products, learning and iterating not only the systems we are building but also our design process. We believe there's something for all of our teams (design, product, engineering, marketing, management, and sales) to learn from our users' and client needs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="Skillbuilding">Skillbuilding</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">The more UX design capability the organization has, they are more likely to deliver well-designed products and services. Teams become more capable and the organization delivers better user experiences. To increase the UX competency in our organization, we encourage all our stakeholders to think from the users' perspective and fight for them. We share our UX processes with all the stakeholders every step of the way so they know how the design team thinks and considers possible solutions. We think this is a great way to increase the UX maturity at Vitech and continue to do this every day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="Communication">Communication</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">Verbal communication alone is insufficient to engage all the stakeholders while building a software product. We believe that people support what they help build, so we engage stakeholders in a co-creative process to bring diverse perspectives, increase the quality of ideas and instill ownership. We invite engineers, product owners, SMEs, and anyone else involved to bring their solutions as pencil-and-paper-based sketches and democratize the process of voting on the sketches. This is a great way to learn from each other and encourage organization-wide skill-building. In the past, we have incorporated some great ideas in our designs that have originated outside our team, from our co-creation sessions.</p>
