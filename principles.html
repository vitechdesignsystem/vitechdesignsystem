    <p class="page-description">At Vitech, we believe that our mission is to create a happy medium between clients, users, and us. We strive to achieve the best user experience while meeting the client's and Vitech's goals. This is done by iteratively testing our interfaces and apps with clients and users, and incorporating their feedback into our process.</p>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="simple">Is it simple?</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">It is vital to minimize users’ cognitive loads and decision-making time. As humans can consciously process only small amounts of information at a time, if the interface doesn't tell them what the objective is on the screen, users can quickly get overwhelmed. To counter this, we adopt a few practices like progressive disclosure, presenting limited choices, using less technical or internal Vitech jargons, etc.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="considerate">Are our products considerate of our users?</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">Most software, especially in FinTech, doesn’t know or care for who is using it, which we leverage as our USP. As a core design consideration, our users must understand that Vitech values our users’ actions and preferences. Building a considerate user experience is common sense more than anything. Considerate products come across as friendly, confident, perceptive, responsible, and less prone to errors. This helps us think of, and improve our products as if they were consumer tech software.</p>

    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="consistent">Are our interfaces consistent?</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">Consistent design is intuitive design and is one of the molecules of the Design DNA. Usability and learnability improve when similar elements have a consistent look and function in a similar fashion. With the incremental rollout of new features in our products, being consistent helps people to transfer knowledge to new contexts (features) and learn new things quickly without pain. This way our users can focus on executing their tasks and not put any effort towards learning how our product UI works. For our clients, a consistent product eliminates confusion, saves money and time.</p>

    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="uncluttered">Is it free from unnecessary clutter?</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">Clutter on webpages decreases user engagement. This relates to our principle of Simplicity, but here, we'd like to take it a step forward. We want to keep content and actions on every interface to the minimum. A minimalist design does not correlate to a plain or bland design, but keeping them uncluttered and only include what is essential to meet the needs of users. We strive to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio by not trying to force on the user what we as an organization think is important, but focusing on user needs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="efficient">Are our products efficient?</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">A highly efficient UX is achieved when the user reaches her/his goals while expending as few resources as possible (time and effort). Note: Our users come from a variety of backgrounds - investors, retirees, etc. For this reason, increasing user efficiency by reducing steps (or clicks) can adversely impact users if it does not conform to existing mental models and expectations based on past experiences.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="empowering">Do we empower our users?</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">Engaging and empowering users makes our products an enjoyable experience to use. It encourages them to explore our apps in-depth by providing visual cues that reveal information on-demand through progressive disclosure. This way, the most important tasks/features are readily presented to the users, while also making the other features easy to discover. The goal here is to empower novice users to master the use of our apps with zero training.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="familiar">Does it feel familiar?</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">Jacobs Law states that users spend most of their time on other sites and users prefer our apps to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. There are several benefits of using familiar design: Easier to develop and maintain a UX pattern library, reduce users’ learning curve, higher user retention, easy on the less tech-savvy users.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="header-top">
        <h4 class="h4" id="progressive">Are our products and processes progressive?</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="section-description">Implementing and rolling new features out to users must be done progressively by validating hypotheses to treat users as equal stakeholders in our products. This also sends a message to our clients that we care for their business by keeping their users happy. For this iterative process, user research and user testing are extremely crucial. This ensures we are building the most valuable features for our users in a way they would find joyful to use.</p>
